# Simple WebScraping

### Introduction

PACKT editor releases each day a different free book on its webpage, we want
to know, each morning, the title of the book, so we can decide if we want to
download it or not.

The webpage is:
https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning/

Your goal is to build a simple python application, using the following libraries:
• urllib2
• BeautifulSoup4

To scrape some text, namely the book title, from the webpage, and print it
(with the ultimate goal of using any notification method to send the user the
information).

### Requirements

• Code must be developed entirely on github.com.

• Code must follow good practice and good python conventions:  variable naming, 
  identation, documentation, etc.

• Code must work.

### DONE

• Get the webpage. In this case: https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning/

• Search the title for the book of the day.

### TODO

• Notificate the title of the book.

### FIXME

• Fix the string of the Title. We must clean-it.
